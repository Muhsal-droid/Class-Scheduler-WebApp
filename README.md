## Name

University of Guelph Course Parser and Search CLI Program

## Description

### Parser

The `parser.py` parses the `Section Selection Results WebAdvisor University of Guelph.html` file and creates a `courses.json` output file containing the universty of Guelph Course details in JSON format.

### Search

Requires `parser.py` to be run first and the `courses.json` to be available.
The `search.py` allowes users to search the `courses.json` file in a CLI using various options.

## Badges

On some READMEs, you may see small images that convey metadata, such as whether or not all the tests are passing for the project. You can use Shields to add some to your README. Many services also have instructions for adding a badge.

## Visuals

Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.

## Installation

Requires Python3+

## Usage

### Parser

`python3 parser.py`

### Search

`python3 search.py`

User will then get a menu for 10 available search options. After choosing an option the user can enter the related search query to obtain a list of course detail results.
